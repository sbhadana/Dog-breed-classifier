# Dog Breed Classifier in PyTorch
This is a repo for the Dog Breed Classifier Project  in Udacity Nanodegree. In this project, I built a convolutional neural network that can classify the breed of dog.
If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

It is implemented by using PyTorch library.

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI  Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that  can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world,  user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will  identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a  human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification  and localization, you will make important design decisions about the  user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab,  you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of  models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.   Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a  real-world application often involves solving many problems without a  perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun  user experience!
